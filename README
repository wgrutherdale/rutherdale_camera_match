Sortable Challenge
==================


To run this program, you need a recent Linux environment with a recent version of Perl.  The program may run in other
environments, but has not been tested that way.

The Perl environment must have the following packages:

    Modern::Perl

If that package is not currently installed, then you must install it.  E.g.

$ cpan install Modern::Perl

Once this has been done, you should be able to cd into this git repository.  If you type

$ ls

then you will see these files:

data  design.txt  LICENSE  matchHeuristics.pm  match.pl  README  README.md
testMatchHeuristics.t

The subdirectory 'data' contains these files:

listings.txt products.txt

which are the data files obtained from the Sortable web site.  This is the
default data that the program will run against.  You can specify different
files using command-line options.

To run some regression tests, do this:

$ perl ./testMatchHeuristics.pl

To run the actual matching program, do this:

$ ./match.pl -h

The above gives help only, and lets you see what command-line options are
available.

To run the actual program against the default data, run the same match.pl program without the help option:

$ ./match.pl

When you do this, the program will read products from data/products.txt, listings from data/listings.txt, process
the data, display some progress information, and output the results to results.txt.

If you want to run this program on different data, read the help instructions.

The file design.txt contains design description.

The file matchHeuristics.pm is an internal library module built as part of
this solution.

The file testMatchHeuristics.pl is a test file to verify matching cases.  It
can be run like this:

$ perl ./testMatchHeuristics.t

Or like this:

$ ./match.pl -t

Note:

You can also potentially improve load-time performance of match.pl by first
running this:

$ cpan install JSON::XS
