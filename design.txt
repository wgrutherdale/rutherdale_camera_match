Notes on Input Files
====================

I went through entire products.txt and confirmed visually line-by-line that
all entries appear to be actual cameras, as opposed to accessories.

Listings.txt, however, appears to contain very large number of entries that
are accessories for camera models, rather than just cameras.

Objective appears to match even accessories accurately against the product
it is designed for. (??)
    - there are some batteries (for example) that match more than one
      camera model -- what to do?

Instructions on web page make it clear that each listing entry is to match
at most one product.
    - there are some actual cameras in listings matching no products,
        - e.g.  fujifilm finepix jv100
        - e.g. pentax rz10
        - e.g. olympus stylus tough 3000
            - oops, this one should match
            - fixed
        - e.g. olympus fe-4020
            - okay, this one should not match
        - e.g. olympus t-100
            - oops, this should match the olympus t100
            - fixed
        - e.g. Olympus Stylus Tough 3000
            - oops, this should match the
              Olympus_Stylus_Tough-3000","manufacturer":"Olympus",
              "model":"Tough-3000"
              entry
            - fixed
        - e.g. pentax optio rz10
            - okay, this one should not match
        - e.g. NIKON D300s (camera body only) + SLRC-201 Bag +
               16 GB SDHC Memory Card + Battery EN-EL3e
            - oops, this should match the Nikon_D300S product
            - fixed
        - e.g. Sony T Series DSC-T99
            - oops should match
            - fixed
        - e.g. Canon Powershot SD4000
            - okay
        - e.g. Olympus-VR320
            - okay
        - e.g. Canon A2200IS
            - okay
        - e.g. Canon_EOS_Rebel_T1i
            - okay

- looks like majority of (non-matching) listings are actually cameras,
  not accessories

Web page also mentions that generic algorithm is to operate, not gigantic
if statements, so that when they run it against different data that we
don't see, it should still work.
